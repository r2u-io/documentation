The R2U SDK allows your website to have access to `augmented reality`, allowing elements, such as a table or appliance, to be designed in the physical world, facilitating tasks such as buying furniture over the internet, for example.

Using his cell phone, the user of an online store can see several characteristics of the product sought with precision, including being able to design it in the real environment.

For users who do not have a cell phone with AR support, we have the `3D viewer` that allows the user to view product details through the 3D model. 

And with our `3D customizer` the user is able to test all the existing combinations of the product and test in augmented reality before making the purchase.
